Scrabble Calculator calculates the word score for any word both horizontally and vertically.
It gets the max and min score and position as well as allows user to select a position.
The word is overlayed in scrabble tiles on a scrabble board.
If the user does not select a position, then each time "calculate" is clicked the program will
generate a new position and move the word around the board providing a new score.

The user can select the score calculator to do either vertical or horizontal.
It also will include the bingo score bonus if the word is 7 characters.
